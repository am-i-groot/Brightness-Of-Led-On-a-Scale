# Brightness-Of-Led-On-a-Scale
## It’s Movie Time! Switch lights on dim with a click!
we will learn how to control the LED using Bolt Cloud.

Imagine you are watching a movie on your laptop and you want to turn off the light of the room to get the feel of a movie hall. What if you can do the same by just one click while sitting on your bed. Sound 's interesting!!

So in this lesson, we will learn how to write code to control the LED.

At this point, we believe that you guys are familiar with Bolt cloud i.e how to create a product and link it to the bolt device. In case you don 't know, then you can refer 'Building your first IoT sensor project 'lesson.
# Problem Instance
Consider that you are using your laptop to watch a movie and that you want to dim the lights as per your wish to create the atmosphere of a movie theater. What if you could accomplish the same thing while seated in bed with only one click? Doesn’t it look amazing?

Therefore, we will learn how to create code for the LED in this project, that will allow you to have a remote-control interface for the lights in your room.

# Components used in this project
BOLT Wi-Fi module, Resistor, LED, Mobile adapter, controller device. 

Executed the JavaScript development codes on BOLT-IOT cloud.

# What this device will help you with?
This device when deployed will help you with the following: -

•	Energy Efficiency: Lowering the intensity when full brightness is not required helps save energy and extends the lifespan of the LEDs.

•	Accessibility: For people with mobility issues or disabilities, remote control LED intensity provides easy access to adjust lighting without the need to move around physically.

•	Mood and Ambiance: Remote control LED intensity lets you set the perfect ambiance for different occasions and moods.
